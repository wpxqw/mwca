## Introduction

WooCommerce Redirect To Page or URL on Add To Cart - Direct Checkout or Skip Cart plugin lets you redirect the user to a page on your website or internal/external URL on add-to-cart button. You can enable this redirection for all or selected products. You can also control add-to-cart button behavior - whether it adds product to cart or not, whether it shows "product has been added to cart" message or not. You can also change the add-to-cart button label for all or selected products for both archive (e.g. shop page) and single product pages regardless of whether redirection is turned on for it or not.
